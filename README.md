## ⚡ About Me

I like understanding how software behaves in the real world — not just in tutorials.

I spend most of my time building systems that actually run:
servers that receive data, databases that store it, and interfaces that display it.

I care about things many projects ignore:
- what happens after deployment
- how an API behaves after 10,000 requests
- what breaks first
- and how to fix it properly

Every weekend (Saturday & Sunday) is reserved for learning and building.  
If I learn something, I implement it. Otherwise I don’t consider it learned.

## 🧠 How I Think

I approach programming as **system construction**, not feature writing.

I enjoy:
- designing backend architecture
- tracing data from client → server → database → UI
- debugging real issues
- converting messy ideas into structured products

My goal is simple:  
**idea → working system → deployed → usable**

## 🚀 What I Build

### Real-Time IoT GPS Tracking System
A working tracking system where a device sends location data every 3 seconds to a backend API, stores it in MongoDB, and displays it on a frontend dashboard.

I built:
- REST API to receive GPS coordinates
- database storage and schema handling
- live data fetching frontend
- serverless deployment
- now extending it into a native mobile app (Flutter) for better GPS accuracy

This project taught me more than tutorials ever could — especially handling real data and real errors.

## 📚 Learning Routine

I dedicate weekends to improvement:
- Saturday → learning new concepts
- Sunday → implementing them into projects

I prefer hands-on learning.  
Tutorials are only useful if they end in a deployed application.

## 🧩 Interests

Outside coding, I spend time on:
- reading (technology & ideas)
- brainstorming product concepts
- analyzing how software startups work
- system design thinking

Late-night debugging sessions.  
2AM architecture thoughts.  
And occasionally remembering to sleep.

## 🎯 My Direction

I’m not trying to become someone who only *knows syntax*.  
I’m trying to become someone who can **design, build, deploy, and maintain complete software systems**.

If you're building something interesting or need a backend engineer who likes solving real problems — I’m always open to collaborating.
